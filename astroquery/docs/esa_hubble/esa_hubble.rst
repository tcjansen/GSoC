esa_hubble (`astroquery.esa_hubble`)
************************************

The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is a joint ESA/NASA orbiting astronomical observatory operating from the near-infrared into the ultraviolet.
Launched in 1990 and scheduled to operate at least through 2020, HST carries and has carried a wide variety of instruments producing imaging,
spectrographic, astrometric, and photometric data through both pointed and parallel observing programs. During its lifetime HST has become
one of the most important science projects ever, with over 500 000 observations of more than 30000 targets available for retrieval from the
Archive.

This package allows the access to the `European Space Agency Hubble Archive <http://archives.esac.esa.int/ehst/>`__. All the HST
observations available in the EHST are synchronised with the MAST services for HST reprocessed public data and corresponding metadata.
Therefore, excluding proprietary data, all HST data in the EHST are identical to those in MAST.

Examples
========

---------------------------
1. Getting Hubble products
---------------------------

.. code-block:: python

  >>> from astroquery.esa_hubble import ESAHubble
  >>>
  >>> ESAHubble.download_product("J6FL25S4Q", "RAW", "raw_data_for_J6FL25S4Q.tar")

This will download all files for the raw calibration level of the observation 'J6FL25S4Q' and it will store them in a tar called
'raw_data_for_J6FL25S4Q.tar'.

---------------------------
2. Getting Hubble postcards
---------------------------

.. code-block:: python

  >>> from astroquery.esa_hubble import ESAHubble
  >>>
  >>> ESAHubble.get_postcard("J6FL25S4Q", "RAW", 256, "raw_postcard_for_J6FL25S4Q.jpg")

This will download the postcard for the observation 'J8VP03010' with low resolution (256) and it will stored in a jpg called
'raw_postcard_for_J6FL25S4Q.jpg'. Resolution of 1024 is also available.

Calibration levels can be RAW, CALIBRATED, PRODUCT or AUXILIARY.

---------------------------
3. Getting Hubble artifacts
---------------------------

Note: Artifact is a single Hubble product file.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> from astroquery.esa_hubble import ESAHubble
  >>>
  >>> ESAHubble.get_artifact("w0ji0v01t_c2f.fits.gz")

This will download the compressed artifact 'w0ji0v01t_c2f.fits.gz'. 'w0ji0v01t_c2f.fits' is the name of the Hubble artifact
to be download.

----------------------------------------------
4. Querying target names in the Hubble archive
----------------------------------------------

The query_target function queries the name of the target as given by the proposer of the observations.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> from astroquery.esa_hubble import ESAHubble
  >>>
  >>> table = ESAHubble.query_target("m31", "m31_query.xml")
  >>> str(table)

This will retrieve a table with the output of the query.
It will also download a file storing all metadata for all observations associated with target name 'm31'. The result of the query
will be stored in file 'm31_query.xml'.

--------------------------------------
5. Cone searches in the Hubble archive
--------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

  >>> from astroquery.esa_hubble import ESAHubble
  >>> from astropy import coordinates
  >>> c = coordinates.SkyCoord("00h42m44.51s +41d16m08.45s", frame='icrs')
  >>>
  >>> table = ESAHubble.cone_search(c, 7, "cone_search_m31_5.vot")
  >>> str(table)

This will perform a cone search with radius 7 arcmins. The result of the query will be returned and stored in the votable file
'cone_search_m31_5.vot'.

-------------------------------
6. Getting access to catalogues 
-------------------------------

This function provides access to the HST archive database using the Table Access Protocol (TAP) and via the Astronomical Data
Query Language (ADQL).

.. code-block:: python

  >>> from astroquery.esa_hubble import ESAHubble
  >>> result = ESAHubble.query_hst_tap("select top 10 * from hsc_v2.hubble_sc2", "test.vot.gz")
  >>> print(result)
  >>> result.get_results()

This will execute an ADQL query to download the first 10 sources in the Hubble Source Catalog (HSC) version 2.1 (format default:
compressed votable). The result of the query will be stored in the file 'test.vot.gz'. The result of this query can be viewed by
doing result.get_results() or printing it by doing print(result).
