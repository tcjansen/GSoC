Google Summer of Code with OpenAstronomy
----------------------------------------

This repository documents my endeavors as a 2019 `GSoC student <https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com>`_ working with OpenAstronomy (specifically `the Astropy Project <https://www.astropy.org/>`_ and its affiliated package `synphot <https://synphot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#>`_), mentored by B. Morris, P. L. Lim and E. Tollerud.  

`Initially, this project <https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/dashboard/project/6656011543248896/overview/>`_ intended to develop a package for simulating astronomical observations (dubbed "telescopy"), but before we began we found that much of this functionality already existed in `synphot <https://synphot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#>`_ - a Python package for synthetic photometry. In lieu of creating a whole new package, we have instead decided to extend the functionality of synphot and other astropy affiliated packages. 

If you're interested in the code I've been working on, you can switch between branches to view the different sub-projects, or you can browse this repository's pull requests.
